This repository contains a Dockerfile with an uncommon error. The original Dockerfile has two issues:

1. Incorrect placement of `requirements.txt`:  The `COPY` command for `requirements.txt` should come *before* the `RUN pip3 install` command. Otherwise, pip will not find the requirements file.
2. Incorrect `CMD` command: The `CMD` command's argument should be the path to your main python script which is `/app/main.py` in this case, but not `python3 /app/main.py`. 

The corrected Dockerfile fixes both these problems. This demonstrates a common subtle mistake in Dockerfile creation leading to unexpected build failures.
